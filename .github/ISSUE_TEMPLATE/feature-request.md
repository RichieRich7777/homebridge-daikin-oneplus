**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe:**
When indoor air quality becomes bad, Daikin Unit suggest running a one clean. One clean turns fan on high to filter more air. 
Problem:
1.	Some homes do not have adequate duct work to run fan on high. Adds stress to ductwork joints and sound of air movement is very loud. 
2.	Daikin does not automatically run a one clean when air quality becomes bad. 
3.	One clean cycle runs for a set time, 3 hours. Even after Air quality become good, unit will continue to run on high.  

**Describe the solution you'd like:**
Allow user to change fan speed from app controls (same as desired humidity). 
Adding this setting allows the user to create automation to increase/decrease fan speed as indoor air quality changes. 
User story: Cooking makes indoor air quality poor. Poor air quality value triggers indoor fan speed to increase. Once indoor air quality is good, fan returns to low.

**Describe alternatives you've considered:**
Create a setting to turn “one clean” on/off. In the event the user selects a “one clean” cycle or automates, fan speed increases as long as there is poor indoor air quality.  

**Additional context:**
<Temperatures throughout a home may vary. In my home I occasionally increase the circulation fan speed when other room become too warm/too cold- the sun may heat one side of a home more. The extra air movement equalizes overall home temperature. Also, the addition of temp sensors could automate a trigger when other room exceed a set temperature.
